Mentoring: jQuery code exercises
================================

A collection of code exercises to use mentoring people in JavaScript using jQuery.

The principle behind these code exercises is to demonstrate what jquery can do, but also understand what jQuery is actually doing behind the scenes.

### Collapsable Lists Exercises

1. Create a collapsable list using pure jQuery
2. Emulate jQuery's toggleClass() with hasClass(), addClass() and removeClass()
3. Emulate jQuery's toggleClass() without using jQuery (pure DOM + Strings + regex)
